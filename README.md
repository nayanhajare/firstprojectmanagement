5. Reflection on Project Management Tools
Using GitHub's project management features like milestones, issues, and project boards has several benefits:

Improved Collaboration: Team members can clearly see their tasks and progress in real-time.
Enhanced Organization: Milestones and project boards help break down complex projects into manageable tasks, ensuring deadlines are met.
Efficient Tracking: Labels, due dates, and linked issues provide a structured way to prioritize and monitor progress.
Challenges: Some challenges include the initial learning curve of using GitHub tools effectively and ensuring all team members update their progress consistently. However, regular communication and familiarity with the tools can mitigate these issues.
